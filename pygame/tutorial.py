            # the pygame window and the python script respectively.

    # Low resolution projects are much easier to manage
    # High resolution game requires time and effort due to the complexity
    # in creating and managing it

    # For every game, we create a window of a fixed size by passing a tuple 
    # of width and height

    # Place both the X and Y values in a tuple, first int is X and second is Y
    pygame.draw.circle(DISPLAYSURF, BLACK, (200,50), 30)
